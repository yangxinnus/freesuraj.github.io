# How to Add a new blog post

Jekyll uses the posts in _posts folder as blog posts.

Create a new file under _posts folder, name it in the format `YYYY-MM-DD-PostTitle.markdown` and write the contents in markdown language.

Add additional info within two ==== lines (see existing post).

Jekyll doesn't use any database, hence information like title, author, date are all written within the markdown file.
