Hello and a Great Welcome to Laohan Blog.

First of all, a happy new year to everybody. 2014 was a year of trial and errors for LaoHan. We were finally able to incorporate LaoHan Pte Ltd officially in Singapore. we have been thinking about doing a lot of stuffs and now it's time we actually start putting words into work.


For mobile and technology, 2014 was another productive year. More powerful iPhone was brought out, the concept of Apple Watch is out and is coming to market very soon. Number of users using android phone grew even more specially in developing countries. Companies like XiaoMi and Huawei took a major cut of Samsung's android market due to their low price. Node.js language got more users than ever before. Apple released a new programming language `swift`. 

As we move forward, I see a slow but certain change in the way companies are thinking about the necessity of having a native mobile app. I've seen a lot of companies are now more focusing on developing html5 responsive web pages that can be directly modified from server end itself. This is something very interesting to see in 2015. How far can html5, node.js can grow. It sure feels like the native app concept is going to die soon.

Here are some review for 2014.
